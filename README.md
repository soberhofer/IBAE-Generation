# IBAE_Dataset

Looking at the results we obtained from the user study, we conducted another round of
generation of IBAE’s where we selected for images with a high amount of attack image
and where we only included images where the final label was the attack label. This resulted
in a dataset of 114 images, all consisting of at least 80% of attack image. Following from
our results, we argue that this dataset should contain a high amount of high quality IBAE’s
where the majority of humans are expected to assign the attack label when classifying
them under a time constraint. Some examples from this dataset are shown below.
